# Ride Sharing Service Smart Contract

## Vision

The Ride Sharing Service project aims to provide a decentralized platform for peer-to-peer ride-sharing, allowing drivers to list available rides and riders to book them without the involvement of a centralized authority. Leveraging blockchain technology ensures transparency, trust, and a fair system for both drivers and riders while promoting shared transportation to reduce environmental impact.

## Features

- **List Rides for Booking**: Drivers can list their available rides, specifying details such as the route and price.
- **Book Rides**: Riders can browse and book available rides, providing a secure and peer-to-peer experience.
- **Availability Tracking**: The blockchain tracks ride availability, providing real-time information for riders to know which rides are open for booking.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Mainnet/Testnet
- **Contract Address**: `0xf8798a66b97678e18869d877cc6348ed1a571655dc83e9e1bdcdc2046cb5c913`

## How It Works

1. **List Ride**:

   - Drivers call the `list_ride` function to make their ride available for booking.
   - The function takes the route description and price as parameters, and stores the ride information, including the driver's address, on the blockchain.

2. **Book Ride**:
   - Riders call the `book_ride` function to book an available ride.
   - The contract checks if the ride is available and then updates its status, marking it as booked.
   - Payment handling is assumed to be managed off-chain in this implementation.

## Future Scope

- **On-Chain Payment Handling**: Implement on-chain payment transfer to facilitate secure transactions between riders and drivers.
- **Ride Ratings and Reviews**: Allow riders to rate their ride experience and leave reviews for drivers, promoting transparency and quality service.
- **Booking System with Schedules**: Add a booking system where rides can be scheduled in advance, allowing drivers to specify availability times.
- **Security Deposit**: Introduce a security deposit mechanism for rides to prevent cancellations without notice.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Enable dynamic pricing based on ride demand and supply to better match market conditions.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, drivers can list rides and riders can book rides through the smart contract functions.
